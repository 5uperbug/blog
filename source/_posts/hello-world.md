Hey there! I'm Aby aka [5uperbug](https://soundcloud.com/5uperbug) (pronounced Superbug). This is a customary Hello World post.

This blog is me rambling about things that are close to my heart i.e, computer science, music production, guitars, food, photography and random puns maybe?

This blog (as of writing this) is written using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), generated as a static site via [Hexo](https://hexo.io) (Have I mentioned that I ♥ Javascript?) and hosted using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).

Stay tuned for more, or maybe don't. This may not even be worth it :P

Stay fab ♥
