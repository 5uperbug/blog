Have you ever wanted to record guitar and bass tracks that sound good while on an cheap budget with equipment you might already have lying around? 

In this post I'll explain how I went about trying to answer this same question and got decent results using DI (Direct Inject) tracks to build a production. 

DI tracks can then be used to [re-amp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-amp) or use with plugins to make your guitar/bass sound awesome. They also provide you the flexibility of not committing to a sound while recording and let you focus on the tracking process.

## Things needed

+ Guitar/Bass
+ An effects processor with a built in USB interface (example: [Zoom G3](https://www.zoom.co.jp/products/guitar/g3-guitar-effects-amp-simulator-pedal))
+ Cables (Instrument and USB)
+ DAW installed on machine
+ Another guitar FX Processor and amp to monitor (Optional)

## Setup

+ Connect your effects processor to your computer and setup your audio device drivers with your DAW. [ASIO4ALL](http://www.asio4all.com) is a good starting point if your device doesn't come with drivers.
+ Connect your guitar/bass to the input of the USB enabled processor and bypass all effects/modelling.
+ Arm a track and play your instrument and make sure the signal is loud enough but not clipping. Alternately you could save a patch with the levels set and recall this whenever you track.
+ You can now record DI tracks on your DAW which can be used to re-amp or use plugins.
+ Optional steps for foolproof, latency free, rock star like monitoring
  + Take a line out from the FX processor and connect it to the input of another processor.
  + Connect this processor to an amp/speaker via the output jack.
  + Mute monitoring on the armed track and use the second processor in the chain for your effects only for monitoring.
